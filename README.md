📋 Overview
TaskMind is not just another summarizer or chatbot. It's a decision & action clarity tool that transforms confusing messages, emails, announcements, and instructions into structured, actionable items with clear deadlines and urgency levels. Built with Next.js and powered by a server-side LLM (OpenRouter) with rule-based fallbacks, local-first storage, and a privacy policy.

🎯 What It Does
Extracts actionable items from any text using Web LLM

Detects deadlines (even vague ones like "by next week")

Classifies urgency with visual indicators

Highlights confusing parts that need clarification

Provides clear next steps

Translates results into multiple languages

✨ Features
🎯 Action Extractor
Uses Web LLM to detect action verbs like submit, attend, pay, respond and converts them into clear, checkable action items.

📅 Deadline Detector
Transforms vague time references ("by EOD", "next Friday", "end of month") into specific dates with clear visual indicators.

🔴 Urgency Classifier
Visual color-coded urgency levels:

🟢 Low - Can be addressed later

🟡 Medium - Should be addressed this week

🔴 High - Requires immediate attention

⚠️ Confusion Highlighter
Identifies and marks ambiguous or confusing sentences, explaining them in simple terms.

📝 One-Sentence Guidance
Provides a clear "If you do only one thing, do this" recommendation.

🌐 Multi-language Support
One-click translation of analyzed results into multiple languages (starting with Tagalog/Filipino).

🔒 Privacy-First Architecture
Local-first storage: history, templates, and your action board live in your browser

Only the text you analyze is sent to the AI provider to generate results, then stored locally

Share links and sensitive analysis details are in your control, with a full privacy policy

Optional login lets you back up data to your own account

🚀 How It Works

text
"Hi team, just a reminder that the final project needs to be submitted via the online portal by Friday. Also, don't forget about the mandatory presentation tomorrow at 10 AM. Late submissions might have penalties but I need to check the exact rules. See you tomorrow!"
